* cf-cname-ctl

  A command line tool to help you easily and quickly update CNAMES in your cloudfront distribution!

  This can be very helpful for automation purposes and CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment/Delivery) pipelines that involve the creation of 'review apps' or the creation of on-demand environments for each branch that have there own unique URLs..


* Installation
  The package is written in `node` and thus may be installed easily via `npm`. `npm` ships with `node` so if you
  don't have it just install `node` and you'll have a working `npm` command soon after. On Mac OS you can just use
  homebrew like so `brew install node`.

  #+begin_src bash
  npm install cf-cname-ctl -g
  #+end_src

* Usage

  #+begin_src bash
  cf-cname-ctl DISTRIBUTION_ID OPERATION CNAME
  #+end_src

  Where ~DISTRIBUTION_ID~ is the cloudfront distribution id to update,
  ~OPERATION~ is one of ~add~ or ~remove~ and ~CNAME~ is the CNAME to act with.

  Example:

  To remove the ~CNAME~ ~app.example.com~ from the CloudFront distribution with ID ~S9H3LE11AJ4QAG~:
  #+begin_src bash
